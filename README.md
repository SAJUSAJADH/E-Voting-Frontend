# E-Voting App on Ethereum Blockchain



## Introduction
Welcome to my latest project, an E-Voting application built on the Ethereum blockchain. This README will guide you through the setup, features, and functionalities of my application.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: Used for writing smart contracts that govern the voting process on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ethers.js**: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for running server-side applications.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing user data and voting records.
- **NextAuth**: Authentication library for Next.js applications.
- **Next.js**: React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SAJUSAJADH/E-Voting-Frontend).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Ensure you have MetaMask installed in your browser for Ethereum wallet integration.
5. Configure the MongoDB connection in the `.env` file.
6. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Features
- Secure voting process leveraging blockchain technology.
- User authentication and authorization using NextAuth.
- Real-time updates on voting results.
- IPFS integration for storing immutable data.
- Seamless integration with MetaMask for Ethereum transactions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
